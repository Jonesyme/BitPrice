### About the project:
The project uses an MVVM-C architecture pattern. The main benefit of the root MVVM pattern over the standard MVC is to maximize testing surface, ensure view state accurately reflects any changes model state and to a lesser extent, discourage developers from dumping the majority of their code into the ViewController. ...although, not to go off the rails on a tangent but I personally believe that if your ViewControllers are becoming too massive, you're probably not approaching MVC in the best manner to begin with but that is a discussion for another time and place ;)

The "C" portion of MVVMC mainly adds an extra abstraction layer between the AppDelegate and your ViewControllers, separating navigation logic from individual view logic, making it easier to modify the flow or screen sequence of the app without modifying individual View or ViewController code.  This separation is not very beneficial in a small example app like this one but in larger projects with frequently changing product specs, it can be quite 
useful.  

Lastly, the solution uses no third-party frameworks or libraries.  I rolled my own network client around URLSession and implemented a binding pattern between Views and their associated ViewModels using a simplified `Observer` pattern based on Swiftâ€™s `didSet` event on class properties.
